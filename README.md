## Notes

- sh run_all.sh  will run for all provided inputs and outputs.
- Noticed that some output files in the `correct_outputs` folder have a newline at the end and some don't. This causes `diff` to fail for some of them.
- Use: diff -bB to ignore the space and new line differences
- All tests pass.
